# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM

This project leverages an LSTM-based neural network implemented in PyTorch to predict future stock prices, capturing complex temporal dependencies in historical price data. Through effective data preprocessing, model optimization, and visualization, the model achieved a high predictive accuracy with an R² score of 0.91 and a low RMSE of 14.92.

## Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict future stock prices using a deep learning approach with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Data preprocessing: feature selection, scaling, and time series slicing
  - Model training and tuning: hyperparameter optimization, dropout regularization, and early stopping
  - Evaluation: R² score and RMSE, with result visualization

## Results

- **R² Score**: 0.91 (indicates that 91% of the variance in stock price movements is explained by the model)
- **RMSE**: 14.92 (low error indicating high accuracy)
